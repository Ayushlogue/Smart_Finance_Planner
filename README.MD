### \# Smart Personal Finance Planner \& Investment Advisor



#### \# Overview

A minimal console-based Python program to estimate tax (New regime), compute net monthly income, deduct monthly EMIs/expenses, forecast savings for 1/5/10 years (assuming 10% annual return), and recommend a simple investment mix.



#### \# Features

\- Student mode: asks only monthly allowance and monthly expenses (no EMI questions)

\- Working mode: asks monthly salary, monthly expenses, and total monthly EMI (combined)

\- New tax regime calculations (simple slab-based)

\- Monthly surplus computation and projections (1, 5, 10 years)

\- Simple, rule-based investment suggestions

\- Exported `summary.txt` and persistent `finance\_data.csv` session log



#### \# Files

\- `main.py` — program source

\- `summary.txt` — generated summary (after running)

\- `finance\_data.csv` — session records (auto-appended)

\- `/screenshots` — recommended folder for submission images

\- `statement.md` — problem statement and scope



#### \# How to run

1\. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.

2\. Open project folder in VS Code or Jupyter/Colab.

3\. Run:



4\. Follow the on-screen prompts (select Student or Working Professional and enter the numeric values when asked).

5\. After run, check `summary.txt` for the exported summary.



#### \# Notes

\- The program uses the New tax regime only (keeps inputs minimal).

\- Projections assume a conservative 10% annual return on invested surplus; this is an estimate, not financial advice.

\- Aligns with VIT BuildYourOwnProject guidelines (modules, workflow, documentation). :contentReference\[oaicite:2]{index=2}
