#                     **Project Statement**



#### \# Problem

###### Students and early-career professionals often cannot quickly estimate how tax, EMIs, and monthly expenses affect their ability to save or make major purchases. Manual calculations are error-prone and time-consuming.



#### \# Scope

###### Provide a minimal, easy-to-use console tool that:

###### \- Asks only essential inputs (student or working professional)

###### \- Calculates tax using the New tax regime (no deductions)

###### \- Deducts combined EMIs and monthly expenses

###### \- Projects future savings (1, 5, 10 years) using a simple growth assumption

###### \- Suggests an investment mix and affordability predictions



#### \# Target Users

###### \- College students who want to plan savings and short-term goals

###### \- Early-career professionals who need a quick financial snapshot



#### \# High-level Features

###### \- Student / Working Professional modes

###### \- New-regime tax computation

###### \- Net monthly income and surplus calculation

###### \- 1/5/10-year projection using monthly contributions

###### \- Simple investment suggestions and purchase affordability checks

###### \- Exportable summary (`summary.txt`) and session log (`finance\_data.csv`)
